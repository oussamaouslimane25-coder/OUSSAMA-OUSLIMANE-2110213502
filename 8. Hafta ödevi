How are clusters found?

Clusters are identified by checking which nodes are connected to each other.
In this program, Depth First Search (DFS) is used to visit all nodes that can be reached from a starting node.
All nodes visited during one DFS call form one cluster.

How are clusters separated?

Clusters are separated when there is no connection (edge) between their nodes.
In the adjacency matrix:

1 means there is a connection

0 means there is no connection

If two nodes cannot be reached through DFS, they belong to different clusters.
