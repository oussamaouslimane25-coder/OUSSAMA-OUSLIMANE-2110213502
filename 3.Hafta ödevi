// Shunting Yard Algorithm (Theory)

1. Definition of the Shunting Yard Algorithm

The Shunting Yard Algorithm is a technique used to convert mathematical expressions from Infix notation (such as a+b) into Postfix notation, also called Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).
The algorithm was developed by Edsger Dijkstra to correctly handle operator precedence and parentheses.
It uses a stack data structure to temporarily store operators while the postfix expression is being built.


2. How the Algorithm Works

The conversion follows these steps:
.The expression is read from left to right.
..If the current symbol is an operand (letter or number), it is added directly to the output.
...If the symbol is an operator (+, -, *, /):
Operators already in the stack with higher or equal precedence are popped and added to the output.
The current operator is then pushed onto the stack.
....If the symbol is a left parenthesis (, it is pushed onto the stack.
.....If the symbol is a right parenthesis ):
Operators are popped from the stack and added to the output until a left parenthesis ( is found.
......The left parenthesis is removed from the stack.
After the entire expression is read, any remaining operators in the stack are popped and added to the output.

3. Example 1: a+b*c

Read a --> operand --> output: a
Read + --> operator --> push + onto stack
Read b --> operand --> output: ab
Read * --> operator
* has higer precedence than + --> push * onto stack
Read c --> operand --> output: abc
End of expression --> pop * --> output: abc*
Pop + --> output: abc*+

4. Example 2: (a-b)/d

Read ( --> push onto stack
Read a --> operand --> output: a
Read - --> operator --> push - onto stack
Read b --> operand --> output: ab
Read ) --> pop operators until (
pop - --> output: ab-
remove ( from stack
Read / --> operator --> push / onto stack
Read d --> operand --> output: ab-d
End of expression --> pop / output: ab-d/


5. Final Results
Infix Expression -->	Postfix Expression
a+b*c -->	abc*+
(a-b)/d -->	ab-d/
